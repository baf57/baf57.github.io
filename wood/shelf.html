                            This is a shelf for boardgames which I built for my
                            roommate and I in order to hold our ever-growing
                            board game collection.

                        <p>
                            I started with researching standard board game box
                            sizes, while also measuring the boxes of the board
                            games we already had. This allowed me to come up
                            with the shelf sizes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I knew I wanted to make the frame out of oak boards
                            and the shelves out of oak plywood. I created a 3D
                            model to determine how I would layout the cuts on
                            the plywood sheet.

                        <p>
                            There are some aspects of this design which I would
                            change if I were to ever make it again. Firstly, I
                            would use lapped joints rather than butted joints.
                            This would lead to more structural stability, and
                            would likely negate the need for reinforcement with
                            screws. I would also change the method of shelf
                            support from sitting on wood rails (highlighted
                            above, left), to instead slot into the frame. This
                            would increase the strength of the shelves as a
                            whole, and would also be cleaner.  Lastly, I would
                            make sure that the height of the shelves includes
                            the lip which hangs down at the top of each opening
                            (highlighted above, right). Better yet, I could not
                            include that lip at all. The lip was included to
                            hide the wooden rails the shelves sit on, however
                            using the aforementioned shelf support system, they
                            would not be needed.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Finished Product</h4>
                        <p> 
                            The shelf stands at 6 feet tall and it made of an
                            oak frame with oak veneered plywood shelves.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The shelves are primarily jointed together using
                            butted joints reinforced by pocket screws. The
                            shelves are very stable and strong, having now
                            successfully held around 1000 pounds of frequently
                            shifted weight for over 6 months now.

                            This is still the largest single project I have done
                            so far. In total, this project took around 80 hours
                            to complete. Since this was my first real project,
                            this included not only the time to work on the
                            shelves themselves, but also the time to create many
                            jigs, learn and practice many different techniques,
                            and also perform some on-the-fly redesign.
