                        <h3>This Website</h3>
                        <p>
                            I created this website originally during the beginning of May, 2020. I did
                            this with a few goals in mind:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Learning HTML</li>
                                <li>Refreshing my skills in JavaScript and CSS</li>
                                <li>Centralizing and/or hosting all my published projects</li>
                                <li>Trying my hand at site design</li>
                                <li>Boosting my personal r&eacute;sum&eacute;</li>
                                <li>Leaning a new API</li>
                            </ol>
                            After this process I now have a functional understanding of 
                            HTML, and could likely make a very wide array of different things using
                            it. My proficiency in Java, as well as my recent exploration with C# was
                            sufficient enough to assure that I had no issues with JavaScript at all.
                            While most projects that I have published are hosted on GitHub, I still 
                            find this to be a useful central hub where I can provide a better 
                            presentation of the projects, as well as categorize in-progress projects.
                            As for site design, I found it to be the most challenging part since I
                            needed to balance what I thought would look good with what I could viably
                            code. I originally set out to learn W3.CSS as a style guide for this site,
                            but decided to diverge from it to have more freedom in my own design,
                            although I did use some of its classes. I decided that from now on I will 
                            keep an updated version of my r&eacute;sum&eacute; hosted on this site. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Speaking of my email, it is not included anywhere in plain text in an
                            effort to assure that it cannot be easily scalped by any bots looking to
                            expand their list of recipients for spam. As a result, any link to my email
                            is not a direct link, but rather is triggered by a JavaScript function to 
                            display the email. Further, any references to my email in other documents 
                            is removed if it would be displayed in plaintext at the top level.

                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am a physicist, mathematician, programmer and
                            wood-worker pursuing a research based MSc in Physics 
                            at the University of Ottawa. I currently have 
                            bachelor's degrees from the University of Pittsburgh 
                            in both Physics and Mathematics and a minor in Computer
                            Science, with a primary academic focus on
                            computational physics and quantum mechanics.  My
                            career interests reside in the areas of fundamental
                            quantum physics, quantum measurement, and
                            computational mathematics.

                        <p>
                            Computers have always been a hobby of mine and I am
                            both self and formally taught in multiple
                            programming languages as well as in a wide array of
                            software. I use Linux (specifically <a
                            href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> testing)
                            as my primary OS, which I also contribute to via bug
                            reporting. I have also always had an interest in
                            digital design and art, and have years of experience
                            with 3D model design and 3D printing software
                            and hardware. For leisure I enjoy cycling, hiking,
                            bouldering, and local music.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My most active hobby is wood-working, which also
                            doubles as a secondary form of income for me. Most
                            of my work consists of furniture making, as well as
                            print framing. Alongside the end products I make, I
                            also make a wide range of jigs, tools, and general
                            equipment to assist me in my work. I have many of my
                            plans hosted on this site, as well as images of some
                            of my completed projects.

                            I have arranged this site into multiple different pages for better
                            organization. Each section should be mostly self-described by its name, but
                            I will include brief descriptions of each here just in case:

                                    3D prints, digital art, wood-working, etc.</li>
                                <li>Wood-Working &mdash; an area for me to post
                                project plans I create and/or final photos
